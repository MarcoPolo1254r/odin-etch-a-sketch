🎨 Interactive Drawing Grid (Etch-a-Sketch Style)

This project is an interactive drawing board built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
It allows users to generate a customizable grid and “draw” on it by hovering over the cells, applying random colors and gradually increasing opacity.

The project was developed as a hands-on exercise to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic styling, and basic UI logic.

🚀 Features

Dynamic grid generation

User selects the grid size (from 2×2 up to 100×100).

The grid is rebuilt dynamically based on the selected size.

Hover-based drawing

Each grid cell changes to a random RGB color on mouse hover.

Opacity increases gradually (+0.1 per hover) until fully opaque.

Random RGB colors

Colors are generated programmatically using Math.random() and applied via CSS rgb() strings.

Reset functionality

Clears the grid by resetting colors and opacity.

🛠️ How It Works
Grid Creation

The grid is generated by creating div elements dynamically based on the selected size.

Each cell’s width and height are calculated as a percentage so the grid always fits the container.

Drawing Logic

Each cell starts with opacity: 0.

On mouseenter:

A random RGB color is applied.

The current opacity is read using getComputedStyle.

Opacity increases incrementally until it reaches 1.

Color Generation

RGB colors are created using a reusable random number function:

Each color channel (R, G, B) is a random integer between 0 and 255.

The result is formatted as a CSS-compatible string:
rgb(r, g, b)

🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

DOM selection and manipulation

Event listeners (mouseenter, click, change)

Dynamic element creation

CSS styling via JavaScript

Working with opacity and computed styles

Clean separation of logic (functions with single responsibility)

🔮 Possible Improvements

The following enhancements would significantly improve usability and overall quality:

UX & Interaction

Draw only when mouse is clicked

Enable drawing only while the mouse button is held down.

Prevent accidental coloring when simply moving the cursor.

Eraser tool

Allow users to switch to an eraser mode.

Eraser could reset color and opacity of cells on hover.

UI & Design

Improve page layout and styling

Better spacing, typography, and alignment.

Clear visual hierarchy for controls.

Active tool indicators

Show whether drawing or erasing mode is active.

Responsive design

Improve behavior on smaller screens.

Additional Feature Ideas

Color picker (choose a fixed color instead of random)

Opacity slider (control how fast opacity increases)

Grid toggle (show/hide grid lines)

Clear vs Reset options

Save drawing as an image

Performance optimizations for very large grids

📌 Final Notes

This project focuses on fundamental frontend concepts without relying on frameworks or libraries.
It serves as a strong foundation for more advanced UI interactions, canvas-based drawing, or even game-like mechanics.

Great stepping stone toward more complex web applications 🚀
